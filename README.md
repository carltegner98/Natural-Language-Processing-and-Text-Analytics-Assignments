**Short Summary**
This project is developed for the Mandatory Assignment 01 of the "Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics" course, focusing on linguistic ambiguity analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. 
The goal is to demonstrate the application of NLP techniques using Python to analyze sentence structures and text corpora for linguistic features.

**Part 1: Linguistic Ambiguity Analysis**
Analyze the ambiguity in given sentences and explain their different possible interpretations. Additionally, use a parse tree generator to compare dependency structures for selected sentences, highlighting differences in the interpretation of the preposition "with".
Implementation: Includes a detailed explanation of the ambiguous meanings of each sentence and an analysis based on the output from the parse tree generator provided by https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanom/syntactic_tree.

**Part 2: Linguistic Analysis of a Text Corpus Using spaCy**
Conduct a detailed linguistic analysis of a provided text corpus (sample.txt) using spaCy for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). The analysis aims to understand the distribution of different parts of speech within the corpus and identify named entities like names, dates, and locations.
